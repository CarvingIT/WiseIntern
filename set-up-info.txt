1. Clone the project

	$ git clone http://git_repository_url

2. Set up your document root to public/ 

If you are using Apache/Nginx or any other web server, create a virtual host.
Think of using a name like wiseintern.local
You will need to add an entry in your /etc/hosts file for this to work.

3. Install dependencies

	$ cd project_directory
	$ composer install

4. Create a database, user and grant privileges

Sample commands
	mysql > create database database_name;
	mysql > grant all privileges on database_name.* to database_user@localhost identified by 'user_password';

5. Copy .env.example as .env and update database credentials.

6. Run migrations (with seeders)

	$ php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
